    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 banana
        <li>75g oats
        <li>3 large eggs
        <li>2 tbsp milk (dairy, soya, oat or nut milks all work)
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder
        <li>pinch of cinnamon
        <li>2 tbsp protein powder (whey, pea or whatever your preference)
        <li>coconut oil, or a flavorless oil, for frying
        <li>nut butter, maple syrup and berries or sliced banana to serve
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whizz the banana, oats, eggs, milk, baking powder, cinnamon and protein powder in a blender for 1-2 mins until smooth. Check the oats have broken down, if not, blend for another minute.
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan. Pour or ladle in 2-3 rounds of batter, leaving a little space between each to spread. 
            <li>Cook for 1-2 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface and the underside is golden. Flip over and cook for another minute until cooked through. 
            <li>Transfer to a warmed oven and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve in stacks with nut butter, maple syrup and fruit.
