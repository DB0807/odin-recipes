    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp white wine vinegar
        <li>4 free-range eggs
        <li>2 toasting muffins
        <li>4 parma ham
    </ul>        
    <h2>For the hollandaise sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>125g butter</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp white wine vinegar or tarragon vinegar</li>
        <li>squeeze of lemon juice</li>
        <li>pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>To Prepare</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a deep saucepan of water to the boil (at least 2 litres) and add 3 tbsp white wine vinegar. Lower the heat down to a gentle simmer.  
            <li>the eggs into four separate coffee cups or ramekins. Split the muffins, toast them for a few minutes either side and warm some plates.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>To make the hollandaise:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan and skim any white solids from the surface. Keep the butter warm.</li>
            <li>Put the egg yolks, white wine or tarragon vinegar, a pinch of salt and a splash of ice-cold water in a metal or glass bowl that will fit over a small pan. Whisk for a few minutes, then put the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk continuously until pale and thick, about 3-5 mins.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the melted butter bit by bit until it's all incorporated and you have a creamy hollandaise. (If it gets too thick, add a splash of water.) Season with a squeeze of lemon juice and a little cayenne pepper. Keep warm until needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To make the eggs benedict:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Swirl the simmering vinegared water briskly to form a vortex and slide in an egg. It will curl round and set to a neat round shape. Cook for 2-3 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the other eggs, one at a time, re-swirling the water as you slide in the eggs. Spread some sauce on each muffin, scrunch a slice of ham on top, then top with an egg. Spoon over the remaining hollandaise and serve at once.</li>
        </ol>
